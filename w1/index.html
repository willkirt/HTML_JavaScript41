    <!--First paragraph contain early life and military-->
    <p style="text-indent: 3em;">I was born in <i>Rhode Island</i> in 1983 but moved to <i>California</i> before I was even a year old. Spent the rest of my life there until I joined the Army in 2002. In 2005 I was deployed to Iraq as a Combat Medic in support of the 1-30th Infantry. I deployed again in 2009 as a Combat Medic with the 103rd Field Artillary. When I return to Rhode Island I was transfered to the <abbr title="Rhode Island Medical Detachment"><em>MedDet</em></abbr> where I took over as the clinical <abbr title="NonComissioned Officer in Charge"><em>NCOIC</em></abbr>. I ran the clinic for close to 8 years under the guidence of the <abbr title="Deputy State Surgeon"><em>DSS</em></abbr> and the unit commander and first Sergeant. After 17 years of service, I was medically retired from the Armed Forces as a Sergeant First Class (SFC/E7).</p>
    <!--Second paragraph contains education and family-->
    <p style="text-indent: 3em;">In 2007 I decided to use my GI bill to attend college. I started at <abbr title="Rhode Island College"><em>RIC</em></abbr> working on my nursing degree, and I eventually decided to switch my major to biology. After my second deployment I went back to school but this time I went to <abbr title="Community College of Rhode Island"><em>CCRI</em></abbr> and earned my <b>Associates in Business</b> and then continued on to earn an <b>Associates in Computer Studies and Information Processing</b>. During this time I fell in love and got married to my wonderful wife, but after less then a year of marriage my step-daughter was diagnosed with <abbr title="Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia"><em>ALL</em></abbr> and I had to take a break from my schooling to help my family. After my daughter was released from <strong>Hasboro Children's Hospital</strong>, and I was retired from the military, I decided to attend <abbr title="New England Institute of Technology"><em>NEIT</em></abbr> to pursue my bachelor's degree in Video Game Development and Simulation Programming. </p>
