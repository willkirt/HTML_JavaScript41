            <p class="txt">I was born in <i>Rhode Island</i> in 1983 but moved to <i>California</i> before I was even a year old. Spent the rest of my life there until I joined the Army in 2002. In 2005 I was deployed to Iraq as a Combat Medic in support of the 1-30th Infantry. I deployed again in 2009 as a Combat Medic with the 103rd Field Artillary. When I return to Rhode Island I was transfered to the <abbr title="Rhode Island Medical Detachment"><em>MedDet</em></abbr> where I took over as the clinical <abbr title="NonComissioned Officer in Charge"><em>NCOIC</em></abbr>. I ran the clinic for close to 8 years under the guidence of the <abbr title="Deputy State Surgeon"><em>DSS</em></abbr> and the unit commander and first Sergeant. After 17 years of service, I was medically retired from the Armed Forces as a Sergeant First Class (SFC/E7).</p>
